                            If you believe you have been exposed to COVID-19 or have symptoms similar to COVID-19, you
                            are
                            invited to complete the COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment to get a recommendation on the next
                            steps
                            to follow, according to your condition. This assessment can be completed for your child or
                            for
                            another member of your family.

                        <p>
                            You can get tested if you are in one of the following situations:

                            You have symptoms of flu, gastroenteritis or COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing).
                            You don’t have symptoms but you’ve been in close contact with someone who has received a
                            positive
                            COVID-19 test result.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Bring your health insurance card if you have one.
                            If you don't have a health insurance card or any other kind of identification papers to
                            provide, you
                            can still get tested.
